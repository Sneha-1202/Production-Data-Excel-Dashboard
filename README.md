### Production Data Analysis: Key Insights & Benefits

This project focuses on analyzing production data to enhance efficiency and decision-making. By using data cleaning tools, we ensure data quality for seamless operations. Additional columns like Age Group and Production Cost per Unit provide deeper insights.
These insights help the company make informed decisions—whether it’s about which products to scale up, which ones to phase out, or how to optimize costs for better profitability. With a more structured and insightful dataset, the company can streamline its operations and drive smarter, data-backed strategies.

### Key Insights:
